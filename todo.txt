- Refactor parser (in workload.c)
    Should be no macro'd limits on max command line args, max lines, max line size
    should support commented out lines
    should support quoted arguments
    should ignore empty lines

- still left on parser refactor
    fix parse_lines to not malloc a second array and copy over
    fix big where cleaned_job_array seems to be accessible in same scope but segfaults in main
